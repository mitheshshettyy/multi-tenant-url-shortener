/**
 * The full set of tenant-scoped operations for one model. Every
 * tenant-owned model needs the identical set of interceptors — the only
 * thing that differs between `user` and `url` is which model they're
 * attached to, not what they do — so this is built once and reused,
 * rather than repeating ten near-identical handlers per model. The
 * predecessor of this file (single-model, `user` only) deliberately
 * avoided this factoring until a second real case existed; `url` is
 * that case.
 *
 * Loosely typed (`Record<string, unknown>` args, not each model's
 * generated `WhereInput`/`Data` types) is a deliberate trade against
 * Prisma's usual per-callsite type inference for extensions — sharing
 * one function across models means giving up some of that precision.
 * The actual tenant-scoping logic itself (`scopeWhere`, `scopeCreateData`)
 * is fully typed and fully unit tested independent of this file; what's
 * loosely typed here is only the Prisma-specific wiring around it.

/**
 * `findUnique` is included deliberately, not rewritten to `findFirst`:
 * Prisma's "extended where unique input" (stable since Prisma 4.x) allows
 * additional non-unique filters alongside the unique field, so
 * `findUnique({ where: { id, tenantId } })` correctly returns null for a
 * real id belonging to a different tenant rather than requiring a
 * different operation. Verified directly against Postgres for `user` in
 * the tenant-isolation milestone; the same Prisma behavior applies here.
